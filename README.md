## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using pure HTML5. 
The layout is designed to resemble the structure of a traditional printed newspaper using semantic HTML elements and table-based column formatting. 
All headlines and articles were translated into English and rephrased in original wording.

## Features Implemented
- Proper HTML5 document structure
- Semantic tags: header, nav, section, article, footer
- 3-column newspaper layout using table
- Inline styling only (no external CSS)
- Multiple images with alt attributes
- Heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, h4)
- Unordered list for breaking notes
- Comments explaining major sections
- Meaningful ID attributes for readability

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was recreating a newspaper-style column layout without using CSS files. 
This was solved by carefully structuring tables and adjusting column widths. 
Maintaining visual similarity while keeping semantic HTML structure was also carefully balanced.
